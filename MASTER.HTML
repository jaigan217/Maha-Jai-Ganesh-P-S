<h1> MASTER </h1>
<p>
<p>It was a variety directional flick from director Lokesh Kanakaraj.The film is a action-packed commercial entertainer.This was a different movie of Vijay comparing to his other films.Vijay as JD rocked in his character as an alchoholic professor and Vijay Sethupathi as the villain Bhavani steals the show.The actresses Malavika and Andrea also did their part well eventhough they didn't had much space in the movie.</p>

<p>The movie didn't had more contents as per the hype and expectations got from the teaser.The length of the film is very unwanted.Many unnecessary scenes could've been trimmed off.Especially the love story of the two college students,bucket fight scene,pre-climax speech.The song Antha Kanna Patthaka was not at all needed.The story needed more depth on JD vs Bhavani.Also a flashback story for JD was to be shown in the film for the completeness on the character.The emotion scenes had not worked out well.</p>

<p>The first half is the whole highlight in the film.When coming to second half,there are lot of lags and boring parts.The climax then again replace everything and makes it an another level movie.</p>
Vijay's different acting with the usual mass style and lokesh's direction has made it a different film.And Vijay Sethupathi was rocking in his villain role.The performances of the both actors made it very interesting to watch.The music directior  Anirudh also need a special mention for making the film score with Great music and BGM.</p>

<p>Watch the film at your own interest and don't go for other hypes and much expectations.You will definitely love it.</p>
